Relevance evaluation:
- Compare the user's message to the persona biography and profile context.
- Determine how close or distant the requested topic is from what this persona would realistically want to talk about or be able to talk about.
- Produce a relevance score between 0 and 1.
- A score near 0 means the topic is far from the persona profile and should be steered, redirected, or rejected more strongly.
- A score near 1 means the topic is strongly grounded in the persona profile and can be answered more directly.
- Consider not only literal overlap, but also whether the persona would realistically relate to the topic, care about the topic, or see it as part of their conversational scope.
